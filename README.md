# SpaceInvaders

Simple video game made with Unity inspired by Space Invaders. Player objective is to protect building from enemiesâ€™ bullets. Game ends when either player or protected structures are destroyed. Player can perform several actions:

All player actions are limited by energy points that increase with each action and decrease with time.
